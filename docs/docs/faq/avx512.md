# AVX512

Since the Expander uses AVX512 by default for proving, you may encounter an `illegal instruction` error when using this compiler.

If you're only using the compiler to compile circuits and then testing the layered circuit with the built-in test function, you generally won't encounter any errors. However, if you use the built-in Expander for proving, you might run into issues.

If you're calling the compiler from Rust, you just need to enable the `avx256` feature, and the compiler will automatically switch to using the relevant AVX2 instructions.

If you're calling the compiler from Go, there are a few more steps involved. You need to clone this repo and then run `build-rust-avx2.sh` to compile the AVX2 library. After that, you need to use this local repo in your Go code.
