# AVX2 and AVX512

Our compiler has an embedded Expander, which uses AVX2 by default to handle the critical proving steps.

Expander supports AVX512, and if you need the additional performance provided by AVX512, in most cases, you can compile a version of Expander using AVX512 and then invoke it via the command line.

If you need to use AVX512 within the compiler, you need to provide the following parameters to `rustc`:

```
-C target-cpu=native -C target-features=+avx512f
```

For example, you can test the crate using:

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -C target-feature=+avx512f" cargo test
```

If you want to use AVX512 for proving in Go, there are a few more steps involved. You need to clone this repo and then run `build-rust-avx512.sh` to compile the AVX512 library. After that, you need to use this local repo in your Go code.
