# Introduction

This category of pages provides some internal information about the compiler, currently including the following content:

- [Compilation Process](./compilation_process) - Describes the compilation process from source code to layered circuit.
- [Artifact and Serialization](./artifact_and_serialization) - Introduces the various files produced by the compiler and their formats.
- [Rust Internal Modules](./rust_modules) - Describes the Rust module structure of the compiler. If you wish to add new features to the compiler, this will be a great starting point.
