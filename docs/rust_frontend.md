# Rust Frontend for ExpanderCompilerCollection

We are thrilled to introduce our new Rust frontend for the ExpanderCompilerCollection. This frontend allows you to write circuits in Rust, leveraging the powerful features of the Rust programming language while utilizing the Expander proof system for generating proofs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Rust frontend, you can refer to the basic example provided in [rust_example.md](./rust_example.md). This example will guide you through the process of writing a simple circuit in Rust and compiling it using the ExpanderCompilerCollection.

## Additional Examples

We have also provided several additional examples to demonstrate more complex use cases:

- [example.rs](../expander_compiler/tests/example.rs): This is the code for the simple example mentioned above.
- [keccak_gf2.rs](../expander_compiler/tests/keccak_gf2.rs): This example showcases the implementation of the Keccak hash function.
- [keccak_gf2_full.rs](../expander_compiler/tests/keccak_gf2_full.rs): This example not only implements the Keccak hash function but also directly invokes the Expander prover to generate a proof.

## API Documentation

For a comprehensive overview of the available APIs and their usage, please refer to the [rust_apis.md](./rust_apis.md) document. This documentation provides detailed information on all the functions and modules available in the Rust frontend, helping you to effectively utilize the ExpanderCompilerCollection in your Rust projects.

We hope you find these resources helpful and look forward to seeing the innovative circuits you create with our new Rust frontend!
